Title: This Week in Rust 341
Number: 341
Date: 2020-06-02
Category: This Week in Rust

Hello and welcome to another issue of *This Week in Rust*!
[Rust](http://rust-lang.org) is a systems language pursuing the trifecta: safety, concurrency, and speed.
This is a weekly summary of its progress and community.
Want something mentioned? Tweet us at [@ThisWeekInRust](https://twitter.com/ThisWeekInRust) or [send us a pull request](https://github.com/cmr/this-week-in-rust).
Want to get involved? [We love contributions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

*This Week in Rust* is openly developed [on GitHub](https://github.com/cmr/this-week-in-rust).
If you find any errors in this week's issue, [please submit a PR](https://github.com/cmr/this-week-in-rust/pulls).

There is no *This Week in Rust* podcast this week, next week's episode will cover both this week and next week.

# We Stand With You

Since our previous issue, there has been a lot of news about the civil
rights discourse in the United States, spawned by the murder of George Floyd
by a member of the Minneapolis Police Department. We stand with Black Lives
Matter and our Black siblings now and always.

We believe this is not a matter of taking a political stance, but a matter
of supporting basic human rights and equality.

We believe that Rustaceans have a duty to our community and to the rest of
the world to ensure that people feel comfortable and welcome wherever they
may be. In our own community, the Rust Code of Conduct explicitly states that
we intend to make everybody feel safe, but this does not just apply to us.

Just as we support Rustaceans, we also support humanity as a whole. It is time
for social progress to be made. We support those risking their own well-being
to show support for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Aubery, and everyone
else who has faced injustice at the hands of members of the police. We stand
with the protesters hoping to make the world better. 

If you want to show your support,
[here is a website of curated resources](https://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co/).
We encourage you to speak out, as one more voice is one step closer to a
better world.
